To periodically clean up the temporary directory and prevent the server from running out of storage space, you can use a combination of cron jobs and shell scripts.

Create a shell script: Create a shell script that will delete old files from the temporary directory. You can use the find command in Linux to find files that are older than a certain number of days and the rm command to delete them. Here's an example shell script that deletes files older than 7 days:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

find /path/to/temporary/directory/ -type f -mtime +7 -delete
Make the shell script executable: Make the shell script executable by changing its permissions using the chmod command:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x /path/to/shell/script.sh
Set up a cron job: Use the crontab command to set up a cron job that will run the shell script periodically. For example, to run the shell script every day at 2 AM, you would use the following cron job:
javascript
Copy code
0 2 * * * /path/to/shell/script.sh
This will run the shell script every day at 2 AM and delete any files in the temporary directory that are older than 7 days.

Note that you'll need to have access to the server command line and appropriate permissions to set up a cron job. You should also test the shell script and cron job thoroughly before deploying them to a production server to make sure that they are working as expected.
